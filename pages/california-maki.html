    <h2>Description:</h2>

    <p>This sushi roll is famous for its "inside-out" style (Uramaki), where the rice is on the outside and the seaweed (nori) is on the inside.<br>This technique hides the seaweed texture, making it perfect for sushi beginners.</p>

     <!-- Ingredients -->

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>

     <!-- Rice -->

    <h3>The Rice</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>2 cups </strong> Sushi rice (short-grain Japanese rice), cooked</li>
        <li><strong>¼ cup</strong> Rice vinegar</li>
        <li><strong>2 tbsp</strong> Sugar</li>
        <li><strong>1 tsp</strong> Salt (Note: You can also buy pre-made "Sushi Vinegar" to replace the vinegar/sugar/salt mix)</li>
    </ul>

     <!-- Fillings -->

    <h3>The Fillings</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Imitation Crab (Surimi):</strong>8 sticks. Shred them by hand or fork and mix with 1 tbsp of Japanese mayonnaise (Kewpie) for creaminess.</li>
        <li><strong>Avocado:</strong> 1 ripe but firm avocado, sliced into thin strips.</li>
        <li><strong>Cucumber:</strong> ½ cucumber, seeded and julienned (cut into thin matchsticks).</li>
    </ul>

     <!-- Essentials -->

    <h3>The Essentials</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Nori (Seaweed):</strong> 4 sheets, cut in half crosswise (you will use half-sheets).</li>
        <li><strong>Toppings:</strong> Toasted white sesame seeds or Tobiko (orange flying fish roe).</li>
        <li><strong>Condiments:</strong> Soy sauce, pickled ginger (gari), and wasabi.</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- Steps -->

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <!--First Step-->
        <li>
            <strong>Prepare the Sushi Rice</strong>
            <p>While the rice is still hot, gently fold in the mixture of rice vinegar, sugar, and <br> salt using a wooden paddle. Fan the rice as you mix to cool it down to room temperature.<br>The grains should look glossy and sticky, not mushy.</p>
        </li>
        <!--Second Step-->
        <li>
            <strong>Prepare the Work Station</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Wrap your bamboo rolling mat (makisu) completely in plastic wrap. This is crucial <br>because the sticky rice will be on the outside of the roll and will otherwise stick to the bamboo.</li>

                <li>
                    Prepare a small bowl of water with a splash of vinegar (called Tezu) to dip your fingers in; this prevents rice from sticking to your hands.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <!--Third Step-->
        <li>
            <strong>Spread the Rice</strong>
            <p>Place a half-sheet of nori on the mat,<strong> rough side facing up.</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Dip your fingers in the Tezu water.</li>
                <li>Grab a handful of rice (about the size of a lemon) and spread it gently over the entire surface of the nori. It should be a thin, even layer.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle the rice generously with toasted sesame seeds or tobiko.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <!--Fourth Step-->
        <li>
            <strong>The "Inside-Out" Flip</strong>
            <p>Carefully flip the nori sheet over so that the <strong>rice is now facing down</strong> against the plastic-wrapped mat, and the bare nori is facing up.</p>
        </li>

        <!--Fifth Step-->
        <li>
            <strong>Add Fillings</strong>
            <p>Arrange your ingredients in a horizontal line across the lower third of the nori sheet:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Lay down the cucumber strips first for a solid base.</li>
                <li>Add the avocado slices next to them.</li>
                <li>Top with the crab/mayo mixture.</li>
                <li><em>Tip: Do not overfill, or the roll will burst.</em></li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <!--Sixth Step-->
        <li>
            <strong>Roll</strong>

            <ul>
                <li>Lift the edge of the bamboo mat closest to you.</li>
                <li>Roll it forward, using your fingers to tuck the fillings in tightly as you go.</li>
                <li>Continue rolling until the rice meets the rice on the other side.</li>
                <li>Give the mat a gentle squeeze to shape the roll into a cylinder (or squareish) shape.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <!--Seventh Step-->
        <li>
            <strong>Cut And Serve</strong>

            <ul>
                <li>Transfer the roll to a cutting board.</li>
                <li>Using a very sharp knife (wipe the blade with a wet cloth between cuts to prevent sticking), <br>slice the roll in half.</li>
                <li>Place the halves side-by-side and cut them into 3 or 4 even pieces (making 6 or 8 bites <br>total).</li>
                <li>Serve immediately with soy sauce and wasabi.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
